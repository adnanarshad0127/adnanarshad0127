### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
 My name is Adnan Arshad, and I am writing to introduce myself as a Data Scientist based in Pakistan. I have recently completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science (BSCS) from Comsats University Islamabad and have been actively working as a freelancer on various platforms.

Throughout my professional journey, I have gained valuable experience in solving complex problems using machine learning techniques. My primary focus lies in tackling classification and regression challenges, employing state-of-the-art methodologies. As a data scientist, I have successfully completed several projects in this domain and have stored them in my repository.

I would greatly appreciate it if you could spare some time to review and rate the projects I have uploaded. Your feedback and evaluation are incredibly valuable to me, as they contribute to my continuous growth and improvement. If you have any questions or need further information, please do not hesitate to contact me. You can reach me via WhatsApp at +92 3225807361 or through email at adnanarshad0127@gmail.com.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your response and the opportunity to showcase my skills and expertise. 

Sincerely,
Adnan Arshad
